# lisp_interpreter
A basic Lisp interpreter written in Python. This is my attempt at the problem posed here: http://pythonpracticeprojects.com/lisp.html

## Running
Run either:

`python3 lisp.py`
or 
`python3 -i lisp.py`

I recommend the interactive mode since it supports normal arrow key functionality within the interpreter.

## Notes
This interpreter was made to at the very least support a very basic version of Lisp, as described in the [project description](http://pythonpracticeprojects.com/lisp.html). As such, error handling with the interpeter is subpar to say the least. But if the syntax is correct, then the programs should run as expected.
